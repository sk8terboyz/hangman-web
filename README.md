**HANGMAN**

This hangman was created for an assignment in my web dev class. I have already created another version of hangman with Python previously, so this time I am planning to focus mainly on the design aspects of it rather than the functionality code. Of course this doesn't mean I won't make it work, it just will be more minimal in JS coding.

In this assignment we are tasked with recreating hangman following the guidelines provided to us and a reference image of a very basic hangman. Although I appreciate the references, I don't like leaving a plain page like that, so I instead decided to make a background gradient and design it a bit differently than my professor intended for us to do.
